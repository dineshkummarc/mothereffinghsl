#  Mothereffing HSL

You shoulda heard that HSL is the jam by now.

For more on HSL, the theory, check out <a href="http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/08/28/coding-colors-easily-using-css3-hsl-notation/">Coding colors easily using HSL notation by Zoltan</a>.

This little app should help to familiarize you with HSL colors so you can create them on the fly more confidently.
